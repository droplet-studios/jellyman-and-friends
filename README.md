JellyMan & Friends is a blog site that I made for my friends, with the original inspiration coming from my turtle JellyMan. Being my first independent website project, it became the place where I experiment with CSS layouts and website designs. The website is currently written from scratch (no Twitter Bootstrap, WordPress, etc.).<br/>
Some notable features:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Responsive layout on all pages</li>
  <li>Media optimised for loading time</li>
  <li>Search engine optimisation and analytics</li>
  <li>Flexbox layout in photo gallery page</li>
</ul>
The website is hosted at <a href="jellymanandfriends.com">www.jellymanandfriends.com</a>. Please take a look!

<b>Edit Nov. 2023:</b> Unfortunately, I have a lot going on right now and development of the website has been paused indefinitely. It is currently still hosted and viewable. I do have many plans for the site which I hope to revisit sometime in the not-too-distant future.
